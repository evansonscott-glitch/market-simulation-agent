## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes directional signals from 96 in-depth simulated interviews with service business operators across pest control, lawn care, HVAC, plumbing, and cleaning verticals. The research focused on four tactical product questions critical to RevHawk.pro’s go-to-market and product strategy. Key actionable findings are:

1. **Strong Preference for Using Existing Marketing Automation Platforms:**  
   Approximately 67% of operators prefer managing retention communications through their current platforms (e.g., HubSpot, Mailchimp, ServiceTitan) rather than outsourcing this to RevHawk. This preference is driven by concerns over control, brand voice, integration complexity, and training overhead.  
   *“Introducing a completely separate communication system just adds complexity and another platform for my team to learn, which I'm not keen on.”* — Tomas Rivera, Pest Control

2. **Operators Possess Intuition on Churn Signals but Lack Systematic Tracking:**  
   76% validated that operators can articulate churn signals aligned with ML models (missed payments, service complaints, seasonal patterns), but many rely on gut feel or manual tracking rather than data-driven systems. This gap presents an opportunity for RevHawk to provide explainable, actionable insights.  
   *“We know we have valuable customer data, but it's not being leveraged effectively to anticipate problems before they escalate.”* — Ethan Coleman, HVAC

3. **High Demand for Automating Specific Retention Communications, Especially Renewal Reminders and Win-Back Campaigns:**  
   76% want automation for renewal reminders, win-back campaigns, loyalty offers, service follow-ups, and review requests. However, there is caution about automation feeling impersonal or robotic. Smaller operators emphasize simplicity and personal touch, while larger operators seek integration and scalability.  
   *“I'd want a solution that pretty much runs itself.”* — Ethan Rapp, Cleaning

4. **Low Openness to Proactive Discounting as a Retention Strategy:**  
   Only 13.5% are open to proactive discounts despite margin concerns; 42.7% are opposed, with many fearing margin erosion and brand devaluation. Alternatives favored include value-added services, loyalty programs, and personalized communication.  
   *“I don't want to train customers to always expect a discount, you know? It can devalue the service.”* — Carlos Mendoza, Lawn Care

5. **Integration and Ease of Use Are Non-Negotiable:**  
   Across archetypes, seamless integration with existing CRMs and marketing platforms (ServiceTitan, FieldRoutes, HubSpot) and minimal training requirements are critical to adoption.  
   *“It absolutely cannot disrupt our current ServiceTitan workflows. That's non-negotiable.”* — Derek Johnson, HVAC

**What to Build Next:**  
- Develop a modular integration-first architecture that augments existing marketing platforms rather than replacing them.  
- Build explainable churn signal dashboards with actionable recommendations to bridge intuition and data.  
- Prioritize automation features for renewal reminders, win-back campaigns, and review requests with customizable, brand-consistent messaging.  
- De-emphasize blanket discounting; instead, enable targeted, strategic incentives and value-add loyalty programs.  
- Ensure low-friction onboarding and “set it and forget it” automation to reduce manual effort.
