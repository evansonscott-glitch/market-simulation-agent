**Interview Guide for Validating RevHawk.pro Assumptions**

---

### Assumption 1:  
*Service business categories beyond pest control (lawn care, HVAC, plumbing, pool service, cleaning) have owners/operators who experience similar churn pain and would pay $200-400/month for predictive churn analytics and retention tools.*

1. **Core Question:**  
   - How do you currently manage customer retention and churn in your business?

2. **If Positive (expresses churn pain or interest):**  
   - What challenges do you face in predicting or preventing churn?  
   - How do you currently track or analyze customer behavior related to churn?  
   - What tools or solutions have you tried or considered?  
   - How much would you be willing to invest monthly for a tool that could reliably predict and help reduce churn?

3. **If Negative (no churn pain or no interest):**  
   - Can you tell me why churn isn’t a significant concern for your business?  
   - How do you maintain customer loyalty without predictive tools?  
   - Have you explored any retention tools before? What was your experience?  
   - What would need to change for you to consider investing in churn analytics?

4. **Validated Response:**  
   - Describes churn as a meaningful pain point with specific examples.  
   - Expresses openness or willingness to pay $200-400/month for predictive analytics and retention tools.  
   - Shows understanding of the value such a tool could provide.

5. **Invalidated Response:**  
   - States churn is not a problem or is negligible.  
   - Unwilling to consider paying $200+ monthly for churn prediction or retention tools.  
   - Relies solely on manual or non-analytic methods without interest in automation.

6. **Red Flags (Sycophantic Responses):**  
   - Overly positive without concrete examples or details.  
   - Quickly agrees to pricing without hesitation or questions.  
   - Uses buzzwords or vague statements without personal experience.  
   - Avoids elaborating when asked for specifics.

### Assumption 2:  
*If RevHawk built a proactive engagement layer that actually executed outreach (AI-powered calls, texts, emails, drip campaigns) instead of just alerting operators about at-risk customers, operators would pay 50-100% more for that capability.*

1. **Core Question:**  
   - How do you currently engage with customers who might be at risk of churning? What would you think about a system that could automatically reach out to those customers on your behalf?

2. **If Positive (shows interest):**  
   - What types of automated outreach would be most valuable to you (calls, texts, emails, drip campaigns)?  
   - How much more would you be willing to pay for a solution that not only identifies at-risk customers but also proactively engages them?  
   - What concerns or conditions would you have about automating customer outreach?  
   - How do you measure the success of your current retention efforts?

3. **If Negative (not interested or skeptical):**  
   - What reservations do you have about automated outreach to customers?  
   - How do you prefer to handle customer retention and outreach today?  
   - What risks or downsides do you see in automating these interactions?  
   - What would it take for you to consider paying more for automated retention?

4. **Validated Response:**  
   - Expresses clear interest in automated outreach and values the convenience or effectiveness.  
   - Indicates willingness to pay 50-100% more for proactive engagement capabilities.  
   - Provides thoughtful concerns or conditions that could be addressed.

5. **Invalidated Response:**  
   - Prefers manual outreach or distrusts automated communication.  
   - Unwilling to pay significantly more for automated engagement.  
   - Does not see added value in proactive outreach beyond alerts.

6. **Red Flags (Sycophantic Responses):**  
   - Enthusiastic agreement without practical examples or concerns.  
   - Immediate acceptance of higher pricing without hesitation.  
   - Avoids discussing potential drawbacks or challenges.  
   - Gives generic positive feedback that sounds rehearsed or salesy.
