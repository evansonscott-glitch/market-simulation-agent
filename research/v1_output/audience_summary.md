## Design Rationale
Weights favor archetypes reflecting resource constraints and desire for automation (overwhelmed founders and automation-first buyers) to validate assumptions about paying for automated outreach. Pest control remains the majority industry to leverage existing customer insights, with lawn care included for expansion testing. Segments are chosen to capture churn pain points and integration needs across diverse company profiles.
