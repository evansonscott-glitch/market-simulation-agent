**Interview Guide for Validating RevHawk Assumptions**

---

### Assumption 1  
*Owner-operators of lawn care companies with 500+ recurring residential customers and annual churn >15% would pay $200-400/mo for ML churn prediction integrated with their CRM, due to lack of systematic early churn ID.*

1. **Core Question:**  
   How do you currently identify customers who might stop using your service before they actually cancel?

2. **If Positive (have some method or interest):**  
   - What tools or processes do you use?  
   - How effective or timely are they?  
   - What challenges do you face with your current approach?  
   - Would you be willing to invest in a tool that improves early identification and integrates with your CRM?

3. **If Negative (no method or uninterested):**  
   - How do you handle customer churn currently?  
   - What impact does unexpected churn have on your business?  
   - Have you considered or tried any solutions to predict churn? Why or why not?

4. **Validated Response:**  
   - Expresses difficulty or lack of systematic churn prediction.  
   - Shows interest or willingness to pay $200-400/mo for a CRM-integrated ML tool that reliably predicts churn early.

5. **Invalidated Response:**  
   - Already has effective churn prediction methods or tools.  
   - Unwilling to pay $200+ per month or sees no value in ML-based prediction integrated with CRM.

### Assumption 2  
*Pest control and lawn care operators who act on <30% of churn risk scores would pay 50-100% more for automated outreach (email, SMS, AI calls) because bandwidth, not awareness, limits retention actions.*

1. **Core Question:**  
   When you receive churn risk alerts, how do you decide which customers to reach out to, and what challenges do you face in following up?

2. **If Positive (acknowledges bandwidth limits):**  
   - What percentage of flagged customers do you typically act on?  
   - What prevents you from acting on more?  
   - Would an automated outreach system that personalizes messages and contacts customers for you be valuable?  
   - How much more would you be willing to pay for such automation?

3. **If Negative (no bandwidth issues or already high follow-up):**  
   - How do you manage outreach for at-risk customers?  
   - What tools or processes help you keep up with follow-ups?  
   - Would automation add value or save time in your process?

4. **Validated Response:**  
   - Confirms acting on fewer than 30% of flagged accounts due to time/staff constraints.  
   - Interested in paying 50-100% more for automated, personalized outreach to increase retention.

5. **Invalidated Response:**  
   - Acts on majority of flagged accounts or does not see bandwidth as a bottleneck.  
   - Uninterested in paying a premium for automated outreach.
