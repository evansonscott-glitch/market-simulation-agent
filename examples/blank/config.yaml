# Copy this file and fill in your product details.
# The simulator will auto-generate a world model if you
# don't provide one — just fill in the product and questions.

product:
  name: "Your Product Name"
  description: |
    Describe your product in 3-5 sentences.
    What does it do? Who is it for? What problem does it solve?
    What's the current pricing (if any)?
    What stage is it at (idea, MVP, paying customers)?
  target_market: |
    Describe your target market.
    Industry, company size, role of the buyer, geography, etc.
    Be as specific as possible — "SMB SaaS companies" is too broad.
    "Series A B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees selling to
    mid-market enterprises" is much better.

# ── What to Test ──
# Use 'assumptions' for things you believe to be true and want to validate.
# Use 'questions' for open-ended things you want to explore.
# You can use both, or just one.
assumptions:
  - "Your first assumption here"
  - "Your second assumption here"

questions:
  - "Your first open-ended question here"
  - "Your second open-ended question here"

# ── Simulation Settings ──
settings:
  persona_count: 100        # 50 for quick runs, 100 for standard, 200+ for deep dives
  interview_turns: 5         # 5 is the sweet spot for signal-to-noise
  interaction_context: "warm_demo"  # warm_demo | cold_outreach | blended
  llm_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"

# ── Context Files (optional, relative to this config file) ──
# These make the simulation significantly more accurate.
# If you don't have them, the simulator will work without them.
context:
  # world_model: "context/world_model.md"       # Market research, competitor data, industry benchmarks
  # transcripts: "context/transcripts.md"        # Real sales call transcripts
  # customer_list: "context/customer_list.md"    # Existing customer details

# ── Output ──
